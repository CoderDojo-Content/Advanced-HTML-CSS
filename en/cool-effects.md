1. Let's add a little movement when you hover over the cards you made earlier! You may remember the **transform** property from the Intermediate Sushi Cards \(when you made things rotate with **@keyframes** animations!\). You can also use it to move something up or down with _translateY_ and left or right with _translateX_. Find the _.card:hover_ CSS class from earlier and change it to the following. Try out different values in the traslate function!
   ```css
        .card:hover {
            box-shadow: 0px 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); 
            transform: translateY(-2px);
        }
   ```
   Play about with different pixel values in the `box-shadow` property to see what they do. 
     
2. _rgba(0,0,0,0.2)_ is another way of defining a colour. It's got the usual three numbers \(from 0 up to 255\) for Red, Green and Blue. The fourth number, called the **alpha** value, sets how see-through something is; it is a number between **0** and **1**.

2. Finally, make the movement smooth by adding the following property to the _.card_ class from earlier: 
   ```css
        transition: all 0.2s ease-out;
   ``` 
   A duration of _0.2s_ means the transition lasts for _0.2 seconds_.

3. Another effect you've probably seen on loads of websites is **lightbox**, where you click on something and the screen dims while something else, like a bigger picture or a popup box, appears in front of everything. To get this effect you will make two links.

4. The first link is for the actual **lightbox**. It contains all the stuff that will appear when you click. Make sure you give the link itself an **id**. I'm doing mine on the Attractions page of my website. You go with whatever page you have pictures on!
    ```html
        <a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="boxLemur">
           <h3>Lemur!!</h3>
           <img src="monkey-2223271_640.jpg" alt="Picture of a lemur" class="bigPics"/>
           <p>A lemur enjoying a little snack</p>
         </a>
    ```
    You can put anything you like in between the link tags. I've got a big picture, a heading and some text. Maybe you just want a picture and no text.
 * It doesn't matter where inside the **main** element you put this code, as you will be making it invisible soon!

4. The other link is of course the thing that you click to make the lightbox appear. Simply add a pair of **a** tags around the element, in this case a smaller picture of a lemur. The **target** of the link will be the lightbox, which you set using the **id**. You might recognise this technique from earlier!
    ```html
        <a href="#boxLemur">
            <img src="monkey-2223271_640.jpg" class="smallPics">
        </a>
    ```

5. Here's the CSS for the lightbox. Can you work out what most of it does?
    ```css
        .lightbox{
            background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
            color: #ffffff;
            text-align: center;
            text-decoration: none;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            position: fixed;
            visibility: hidden;
            z-index: 999;
        }
        .lightbox:target {
            visibility: visible;
        }
    ```
    Setting the **position** property to _fixed_ means it stays put when you scroll. The `:target` **pseudo-class** only applies when the lightbox was the target of the last link clicked. So when you click anywhere the **visibility** will be set back to hidden.

6. You can add as many lightboxes as you want to a page. They can all use the same CSS class. Just make sure each one has a different **id**! For each one, you need to make something on your webpage into a link that you can click to make the lightbox appear, and you use the **id** as the **href** value in that link; just you've done above!
