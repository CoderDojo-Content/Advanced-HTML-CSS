1. Do you find that when you add a picture you also add some text that goes with it? Then you could make use of a special element for that exact purpose!
2. Find an `img` element where you have text describing it, for example underneath. I'm working with the Tito picture on index.html, but you can go with whatever is on your website.  

   ```
      <img id="imgTito" class="solidRoundBorders" src="tito.png" alt="Tito the dog">  		
      <p>
        This is Tito. He will be your tourguide! As you can see, Tito loves CoderDojo.
      </p>
   ```
