1. Do you find that when you add a picture you also add some text that goes with it? Then you could make use of a special element for that exact purpose: `fig`!
2. Find an `img` element where you have text above or below that goes with the picture. I'm working with the Tito picture on index.html, but you can go with whatever is on your website.  

   ```html
      <img id="imgTito" class="solidRoundBorders" src="tito.png" alt="Tito the dog" />  		
      <p>
        This is Tito. He will be your tourguide! As you can see, Tito loves CoderDojo.
      </p>
   ```
3. On the line above the `img` element, add the tag `<fig>`. Place the closing tag `<\fig>` on a new line after the text element.
