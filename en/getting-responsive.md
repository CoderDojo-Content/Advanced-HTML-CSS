1. A **responsive** website is one that adjusts itself to the screen size: so it always looks great whether you're looking at it on a computer, mobile phone or tablet. One way to make your website **responsive** is with the **Flexbox**.
2. 

1. Create a div with a few pictures in it. They are arranged vertically.
2. set parent to display: flex; ----> they become horizontally arranged!
3. margin: auto; on the items ---> centered horizontally (possibly put this into total layout control as a neat trick in advance)
