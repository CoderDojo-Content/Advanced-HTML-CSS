1. Divs
2. Positioning

1. By now you've seen plenty of different **container** elements for grouping and organising content on your website. But sometimes you just need something else. Something **generic** 
 But there's one more... and it has no special purpose: the `div`. It's a **generic** container that you can use when you need to group stuff to achieve a particular layout.

* throw in a simple picture? prob help a lot to demonstrate positioning....

* it's really important to use the **semantic** elements whenever you can. Reasons - structure, screen readers, divs can make a page messy very quickly.

* show the margin: auto trick for centering elements! (should this be in intermediate???)
